=== Installing ===

== Prerequisites ==

This program has only been tested on Linux, but if you know what you're doing,
you could probably easily compile it for just about anything.

You'll need these libraries: sdl, sdl-mixer, sdl-image, libogg and libpng

To build from a git pull, you'll also need inkscape and ruby to build the skin.
You'll also need FreeSerif.ttf and some ogg files named "test_1.ogg",
"test_2.ogg", "test_3.ogg", "test_4.ogg" and "test_5.ogg" in this directory.

== Building ==

Type "make" in this directory.


== Running ==

Type "./somp" in this directory.


== Editing the skin ==

Prerequisites: You'll need to have inkscape and ruby installed.

To change the look of the player, you can edit skin.svg in inkscape.

You can move all the pieces around, because they are found by the build script
by their object id. If you want to replace an element: note it's "id" under
"object properties" with another element, delete it, create your new element,
and go to "object properties" and set the "id" to the id of the element you're
replacing.

If you change the dimensions you'll need to update canvas_height and
canvas_width in read_skin_coords.rb

When you're done editing skin.svg run "make" to rebuild.
