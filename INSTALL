=== Installing ===

== Prerequisites ==

This program has only been tested on Linux, but if you know what you're doing,
you could probably easily compile it for just about anything.

You'll need these libraries: sdl, sdl-mixer, sdl-image, libogg and libpng


== Building ==

Type "make" in this directory.


== Running ==

Type "./radio" in this directory.


== Editing the skin ==

Prerequisites: You'll need to have inkscape and ruby installed.

To change the look of the player, you can edit skin.svg in eg inkscape.

You can move all the pieces around, because they are found by the build script
by their object id.

When you're done editing skin.svg run "make" to rebuild.
