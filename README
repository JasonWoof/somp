===  About Open Content Radio  (name will probably have to change later) ===

This is a free software music player that will automatically download free
(Creative commons or the like) music and play it for you. It will adjust the
music to your tasts as you rate the songs it plays.

Status: Very early development. The interface is starting to work, and it just
alternates between two hard-coded test tracks.
